# PlasmaFractal

<img src="/screenshots/thumbs/SeethingOnWhite.jpg" alt="Screenshot" title="Screenshot" width="150">

Oldschool PlasmaFractal revival with Perlin Noise and WebGL.
Fully customizable via dynamic VueJS based UI. 

Basic algorithm (fragment shader):
- For each pixel, grayscale value is calculated by calling Perlin Noise or other noise functions.
- RGB color is generated by using grayscale value as palette index.
- To produce fractal, add multiple noise values of increasing frequencies and decreasing amplitudes per pixel.

Animation
- Noise can be mutated by taking a slice of 3D noise and incrementing the Z position over time.
- A turbulence effect can be achieved by incrementing the Z position faster for each octave of fractal.
- Palette can be animated by rotating the palette entries and by blending between random colors.

## [Live demo](https://zett42.github.io/PlasmaFractalGL/)
- Double-click to toggle fullscreen.
- Press the "gear" button in the top-left corner to adjust plasma options.
- When you are happy with your settings, share the Permalink with your friends.

### Requirements and browser support:
- Requires WebGL2 support by browser.
- Requires [Offscreen Canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/OffscreenCanvas) (experimental API) support by browser.
- :white_check_mark: Tested successfully with Chrome v76.0.3809.100 and Opera v63.0.3368.71.
- :warning: Firefox currently not supported (tested with v69.0, which is still [missing some OffscreenCanvas support](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=801176)). 
  - Note that the [old version of the PlasmaFractal](https://zett42.github.io/PlasmaFractal/) still works with Firefox!
